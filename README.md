# @ndim/codemirror-lang-zig

This is a fork of mattmundell's [codemirror-lang-zig repo on SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~mattmundell/codemirror-lang-zig). It has been updated to the latest Zig language changes as of 0.15.2, and refactored to split out the Lezer grammar into a separate package published as @ndim/lezer-zig.
